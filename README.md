# Flashy Martials for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous 

Adds homebrew martial classes that can do more than just run up to people and hit them. May not be very balanced. Suggestions are welcome.   

## Featuring

### Path of the Perfect Strike

#### 1st level 
- You gain the ability to focus. While focused, you add your Wisdom modifier to attack rolls. You start combat focused. Attacking breaks focus.
- You gain a pool of Insight, a number of points equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may spend insight to quicken your actions.
- Focus: Focus yourself as a move action. This can be performed as a swift action for one insight or as a free action for two insight.

#### 4th level
- Lightning Strike: You can perform a lightning quick strike with increased range while focused as a standard action. This can be performed as a swift action instead at the cost of one insight.

#### 7th level
- You gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to your Wisdom modifier against flat-footed enemies.
- Perfect Strike: You can perform a quick strike to inflict devastating damage as a full round action while focused. Multiply your damage, including any bonuses that would be multiplied on a critical hit, by the number of attacks you may make on a full attack. This can be performed as a standard action instead at the cost of two insight.

#### 10th level
- Lightning Strike and Perfect Strike treat your target as flat-footed.
