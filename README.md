# Flashy Martials for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous 

Adds homebrew martial classes that can do more than just run up to people and hit them. May not be very balanced. Suggestions are welcome.   

## Featuring

* Path of the Perfect Strike

**1st level 
*** You gain the ability to focus. While focused, you add your Wisdom modifier to attack rolls. You start combat focused. Attacking breaks focus.
*** You gain a pool of Insight, a number of points equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may spend insight to quicken your actions.

** 4th level
*** You can perform a lightning quick strike with increased range while focused.

** 7th level
*** You gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to your Wisdom modifier against flat-footed enemies.
*** You can perform a quick strike to inflict devastating damage while focused. Multiply your damage, including any bonuses that would be multiplied on a critical hit, by the number of attacks you may make on a full attack.

** 10th level
*** Lightning Strike and Perfect Strike treat your target as flat-footed.
